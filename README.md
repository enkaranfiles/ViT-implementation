# ViT - (Vision Transformer)

In this project, we're going to be replicating a research paper and creating a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using PyTorch.

More specifically, we're going to be replicating the machine learning research paper An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (ViT paper) with PyTorch.

The Transformer neural network architecture was originally introduced in the machine learning research paper Attention is all you need.
